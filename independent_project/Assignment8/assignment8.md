# NIDA Cannabis Does Not Reflect Legal Markets
## Summary of Data to be Analyzed
### Original Study - Goals
This study compares the cannabinoid levels found in _Cannabis_ samples taken from plants grown in four US cities and plants produced by The National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA). The overall goal of the study was to examine whether the _Cannabis_ available in legal markets, reflects the plants (those mainly used in US laboratory studies) available through NIDA in relation to cannabinoid content. Much is still unknown about _Cannabis_ and this study points out a critical issue with the data intended to be used in US labs for further research. 
### Methodology
The study utilized the cannabinoid profile variations among plants from four different US cities (Denver, Oakland, Sacramento, and Seattle) and the cannabinoid contents of plants supplied for research purposes by NIDA using data publicly available on their website.
### Data
**Format:** Two .txt files - one containing the full raw data of chemotypes and one containing the data for the Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
**Size:** full raw data - 276.5 kb; PCA - 92.59 kb
**Inconsistencies:** There is a fair amount of missing/unavailable information
**What does the data represent about the biology?:** This data contains cannabinoid information for the following cannabinoids: CBD, CBN, THC, CBG, and THCV.

## Description of Analysis / Challenges
I would like to repeat the analyses performed in the study including the overall cannabinoid comparisons by location, the two phytochemical diversity analyses by location and the potency analyses. I would also like to include a potency analyses for the samples from each location separately to display the variation in potency for each city. I am curious to see the differences which city has overall the most “potent” strains of the samples and compare those to the NIDA samples as well. I would also like to run a variety of statistical analyses to examine the data further and to determine further inconsistencies. One challenge could be involved with the lack of data available and if there is a large enough sample size to draw specific conclusions.
